<p>This variable is the current request URI, without any arguments (see $args for those). This variable will reflect any modifications done so far by internal redirects or the <a href="/HttpIndexModule#index" title="HttpIndexModule">index</a> module. Note this may be different from $request_uri, as $request_uri is what was originally sent by the browser before any such modifications. Does not include the protocol or host name. Example: <code>/foo/bar.html</code> </p>
