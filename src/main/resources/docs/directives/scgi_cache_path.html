All data is stored in the files. The cache key and the name of cache file are calculated as MD5 sum of the proxied URL. </p><p>Level parameter sets number and width of the names of subdirectories used to store caching files. For example, with the directive like: </p><div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
 <div class="nginx source-nginx">
  <pre class="de1">scgi_cache_path  /data/nginx/cache  levels<span class="sy0">=</span><span class="nu0">1</span>:<span class="nu0">2</span>   keys_zone<span class="sy0">=</span>one:10m<span class="sy0">;</span></pre>
 </div>
</div><p>the data will be stored in the following file: </p><div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
 <div class="nginx source-nginx">
  <pre class="de1">/data/nginx/cache/c/<span class="nu0">29</span>/b7f54b2df7773722d382f4809d65029c</pre>
 </div>
</div><p>Caching data is first written to the temporary file which is then moved to the final location in a cache directory. Starting from 0.8.9 it is possible to store temporary and cache files on different file systems, but it should be kept in mind that in such a case instead of cheap and atomic rename syscall a full file copy is performed. So it's better to use the same file system in both parameters of <a href="#scgi_temp_path">scgi_temp_path</a> and <code>scgi_cache_path</code> directives. </p><p>In addition, all active keys and information about data are kept in the shared memory zone, which name and size are specified by the options of the <code>key_zone</code> parameter. In case this data haven't been accessed for the time, specified in the option of <code>inactive</code> parameter, it is wiped out from the memory. By default inactive period is set to 10 minutes. </p><p>To maintain the maximum size of the cache, which is set by <code>max_size</code> parameter, a special process <b>cache manager</b> periodically deletes old data from the cache. </p><br><i>Module: HttpScgiModule</i>
