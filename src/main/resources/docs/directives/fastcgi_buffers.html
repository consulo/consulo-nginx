--> </p><p><br /> This directive sets the number and the size of the buffers into which the reply from the FastCGI process in the backend is read. </p><p>fastcgi_buffers should be set to the typical fastcgi response size. You should handle most of responses in memory while the biggest responses are buffered to disk. </p><p>If you want to disable buffering to disk for all replies that are greater than the FastCGI buffers and transfer data synchronously to the client set <a href="/HttpFcgiModule#fastcgi_max_temp_file_size" title="HttpFcgiModule" class="mw-redirect">fastcgi_max_temp_file_size</a> to 0. </p><p>The fastcgi_buffer is equivalent to: <code>fastcgi_buffer_size + the_number * is_size </code> </p><p>If a fastcgi response is 12k then <code>fastcgi_buffers 64 4k</code> will allocated 3 buffers of 4k. This is why fastcgi_buffers has two parameters, while <a href="/HttpFcgiModule#fastcgi_buffer_size" title="HttpFcgiModule" class="mw-redirect">fastcgi_buffer_size</a> (used for response header and first part) has just one paramter. After <a href="/HttpFcgiModule#fastcgi_buffer_size" title="HttpFcgiModule" class="mw-redirect">fastcgi_buffer_size</a> has been emptied, it used together with fastcgi_buffers. </p><p>Example: </p><div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
 <div class="nginx source-nginx">
  <pre class="de1"><a href="/NginxHttpFcgiModule#fastcgi_buffers"><span class="kw11">fastcgi_buffers</span></a> <span class="nu0">256</span> 4k<span class="sy0">;</span> <span class="co1"># Sets the buffer size to 4k + 256 * 4k = 1028k</span></pre>
 </div>
</div><p>This means that any reply by the FastCGI process in the backend <b>greater</b> than 1M goes to disk. Only replies below 1M are handled directly in memory. </p><p>By default, the size of each buffer is equal to the OS page size. Depending on the platform and architecture this value is one of 4k, 8k or 16k. </p><p>On Linux you can get the page size issuing: </p><pre>
getconf PAGESIZE
</pre><p>it returns the page size in bytes. </p><br><i>Module: HttpFastcgiModule</i>
